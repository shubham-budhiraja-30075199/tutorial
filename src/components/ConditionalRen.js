            Ternary Conditional Operator & Short Circuit Operator</strong>.</li>
            <li>if/else, element variables and ternary conditional operators are the basic conditional operations done in JS and TextUtils.</li>
            <li>For short curcuit operators, we use <strong>&&</strong> for conditional rendering, in which, on left side of &&, 
            the condition which must be true should be added and then on right side of && - comes the JSX.</li>
